        <h2>Our methodology</h2>
        <p>If you’re going to boldly strive to be better every day, blasting past best practices and fashioning brand-new, tricked-out better practices, you darn well better have a fancy-pants methodology, a slicker-than-slick process or a performance-proven approach–you know, a buzzwordy thing that helps you kill it for clients over and over again on the daily. Well, we call that buzzwordy thing: Think/Make/Market/Measure. It’s the process we use to dive into every new engagement, and it’s also how we iterate to achieve creative digital performance marketing results every single day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="art">
        <h2>The way we think</h2>
        <p>Now, we could throw a bunch of edgy, highbrow, thought-leadership babble at you here, but we won’t. Because we understand behind every great brand is a great strategy. And great strategic thinking starts with a simple, all-too-human act: Listening. We listen to you, to your people, to your customers, to your competitors, to your suppliers, to the press and social media channels, to the nice folks who clean your offices at night, and to your FedEx guy, if the opportunity presents. Because listening makes ideas happen. When data slams full-speed into gut-level intuition, sparks fly, intellects collide, and loving fierce debate gives way to fertile common ground. That’s when new potentials introduce themselves, barriers step gingerly aside, and brave, deliberate paths to success stretch out before us. Hello, living strategy!</p>

      <div class="art">
        <h2>Our measurements</h2>
        <p>There are people in this world for whom statistics and data collection are honest-to-goodness passions. The kind of people who utilize terms like “algorithmic shift” in their everyday speech, and who can turn complex data into pure unblinking opportunity. The kind of big-brained, analyst-optimizers who thrive here at Noble Studios. Armed with a crystal-clear articulation of your business goals, a set of mutually crafted key performance indicators, and an arsenal of tools and methodologies that would give most mortals a migraine, these dauntless detectives of insight are here to help you implement your brand strategy into the digital marketplace, creating measurable advantages for our business along the way. Advantages like a detailed understanding of your audience’s behavior patterns. Like how to make yourself more visible and accessible to that audience. How to engage them more deeply. How to meet their needs more completely. And how to do it all with greater cost-efficiency. Are they nerds? Maybe. Are they tireless, value-forging, relationship-driving, game-changers for any client seeking greater relevance, more robust ROI, and a leg up on the competition? Most definitely. And they have the numbers to prove it.</p>
