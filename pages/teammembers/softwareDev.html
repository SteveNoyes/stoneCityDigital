        <h2 class="orangetx">Software Developer</h2>
        <p class="whitetx">At every place I've worked I've found that there are three things employers are looking for. They want someone who can perform the job duties, someone who is easy to work with, and overall someone who is a good person. Oddly, there are plenty of people out there who can do the job, but being a decent human being is what's stopping them from really being productive and contributing to the team they are on.</p>
        <p class="whitetx">As a developer, I do my absolute best to write good clean code, follow the best practices I'm aware of, and stay up to date with the new frameworks and patterns that are constantly being released. But as a person and employee, I'm striving to be that great team member and good person that makes me easy to work with and great with clients. In conversations internally or externally people want to feel safe, that their voice is being heard, and that their concerns are being given value. I enjoy not only making sure they feel that what they are concerned about I am concerned about, but delivering solutions to those concerns.</p>
        <p class="whitetx">With my decade-long experience as a mountain guide I've learned that the only way to approach the mountains is humbly and with no ego. I bring that outlook and experience to my career as a developer, open to new ideas and ways of thinking, and realizing there are many ways to reach the end goal.</p>
